When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

          advantages and our very first innovation is already a published patent (3966/MUM/2015)</p>
          <p class="font"> The main object of the startup is to provide a novel automatic dimming device for automobiles which can automatically judge the required intensity of
            the headlamps of the vehicles. It will reduce the number of road accidents by 70%. It will replace the manual dipper system in the vehicles whic
            install this device in their vehicles by just referring to user manual.
            It solves a problem which makes it mandatory to use. If at the right time the government is pitched and made understand its importance it will be a
            mandatory device to be fitted in vehicles and hence it can increase the market capture by 60%.</p>

Everyone seems to know this, but nobody is really doing anything about it. If somebody is doing anything, that too seems to create a very small dent - almost negligible - dent in the number of accidents taking place.<br><br>

          We wish to change this scenario.<br>
          We aspire to change the experience of the very way you travel.<br>
          We desire to make it much more safer, better and memorable for a positive reason.<br>
          We aim to make “travelling by road” one of the safest mode to commute.</p>
